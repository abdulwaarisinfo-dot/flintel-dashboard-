FLINTEL v9.11 — Reddit (SERP Discovery, FETCH-ONCE-FOREVER KEYWORD CACHE
                + BATCHED SEARCH-VOLUME PRE-SEEDING)
                + Twitter/X Signal Scorer
=================================================================================
Platforms : Reddit — RapidAPI SERP discovery ONLY (Google search,
            site:reddit.com, real per-post rank -> Reddit public per-post 
            RSS feed, smart-retry, no credentials required)
          + Twitter/X (tweepy v2)

=================================================================================
WHAT CHANGED IN THIS BUILD (v9.11.1) — KEYWORD CACHE IS NOW THE SOLE
SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR "DUE" / "MISSING VOLUME", INDEPENDENT OF THE PYTHON
LIST. LOGIC 100% AS-IS OTHERWISE.
=================================================================================

  ISSUE (confirmed, not a code bug elsewhere): get_due_keywords() and
    get_keywords_missing_volume() were filtering flintel_keywords with
    {"keyword": {"$in": REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS}} — i.e. against whatever
    the REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS python list happens to contain RIGHT NOW.
    That meant: if a keyword was ever removed from (or swapped out of)
    the python list — even though it was already stored in
    flintel_keywords with fetched=False (never actually processed) or
    search_volume=None (never actually seeded) — it would silently stop
    being picked up. It wasn't deleted from Mongo, it just became
    invisible to these two queries because it no longer matched the
    CURRENT python list. That's the python list "forgetting" a keyword
    that Mongo still has pending — which is backwards: flintel_keywords
    is supposed to be the permanent, restart-safe record; the python
    list is supposed to be nothing more than "what to make sure EXISTS
    in that record" (via sync_keywords_to_db()'s $setOnInsert, which was
    already correctly insert-only and untouched by this fix).

  FIX — get_due_keywords() and get_keywords_missing_volume() now query
    flintel_keywords DIRECTLY, with NO "$in: REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS"
    restriction at all:
      - get_due_keywords()          -> find({"fetched": False})
      - get_keywords_missing_volume() -> find({"search_volume": None})
    So ANY keyword sitting in flintel_keywords with fetched=False (or
    search_volume=None) is picked up and processed on the very next
    pass — regardless of whether that keyword is still present in the
    REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS python list at that moment. If you edit the
    python list and remove/replace a keyword, the OLD keyword's
    flintel_keywords document is untouched (nothing here ever deletes
    from that collection) and it is still fetched exactly as before —
    the python list swap does not erase or hide it. The root() status
    endpoint's "keywords_due_now" / "keywords_missing_search_volume" /
    "keywords_with_random_search_volume" counters were changed the same
    way (dropped the same "$in: REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS" restriction) so
    they stay consistent with what the loop itself will actually pick up.

    Everything else about the keyword-cache system is UNCHANGED:
    sync_keywords_to_db() still only INSERTS brand-new keywords from the
    python list via $setOnInsert (never touches/overwrites an existing
    doc), mark_keyword_fetched() still permanently flips fetched=True
    with no TTL/re-due date, and the "fetch a keyword exactly once,
    ever" guarantee is untouched — this fix only removes the accidental
    extra python-list filter sitting on top of the two read queries, it
    does not change how/when keywords get inserted, marked fetched, or
    seeded with volume.

=================================================================================
CARRIED FORWARD FROM v9.11 — REDDIT FETCH SWITCHED FROM .json TO
RSS (per-post) + RANDOM ENGAGEMENT FALLBACK, LOGIC 100% AS-IS OTHERWISE
=================================================================================

  ROOT CAUSE (confirmed, not a code bug): Reddit's public, anonymous
    .json endpoint was returning 403 on EVERY attempt, on BOTH the
    primary host (www.reddit.com) AND the old.reddit.com fallback host,
    across every retry/backoff cycle. That pattern — 100% failure across
    every attempt on both hosts — is the signature of Reddit blanket-
    blocking the server's IP itself (very common for cloud/datacenter
    IP ranges) for anonymous .json/API-shaped traffic. No amount of
    request-shape/pacing/User-Agent tuning on that endpoint can fix an
    IP-level block. The SERP/Google-rank discovery call
    (search_google_for_keyword()) was NEVER affected by this — it runs
    on a completely separate RapidAPI host and kept returning real post
    URLs + ranks the whole time, exactly as logged.

  CHANGE 1 — Reddit per-post fetch switched from the .json endpoint to
    Reddit's public per-post RSS feed (same URL, `.rss` suffix instead
    of `.json` — e.g. .../comments/<id>/<slug>.rss), fetched with the
    exact same v9.6 smart-retry (proper User-Agent, jittered exponential
    backoff, old.reddit.com fallback host) — nothing about the retry
    logic changed, only the URL suffix and the response parser (RSS/Atom
    via feedparser instead of JSON). This mirrors the RSS-based approach
    already used for Reddit elsewhere, just applied to a single known
    post_url (from SERP discovery) instead of a whole subreddit's
    /new.rss feed, since the exact post is already known here.

  CHANGE 2 — Reddit's RSS format does NOT expose numeric upvotes or
    comment counts (this is a genuine schema limitation of Reddit's RSS
    feeds, not a parsing bug — those fields simply are not present in
    the feed). Since Component 3 (Engagement Signal) of the Claude
    scoring model needs a numeric upvotes/comments value to score
    against, `upvotes` and `comments` are now generated as a random
    placeholder in the REDDIT_ENGAGEMENT_RANDOM_FALLBACK_MIN..MAX range
    (default 100-3000, env-configurable) for every Reddit post fetched
    via RSS — the exact same "random fallback" pattern already used for
    search_volume: every single occurrence is logged with a clearly-
    labelled "RANDOM FALLBACK" warning naming the exact values used and
    the reason (Reddit RSS does not expose engagement counts), and the
    item carries an `engagement_is_random` flag through to the "SAVED"
    log line, so it is always distinguishable in the logs from a real,
    provider-returned number — never silently indistinguishable.

    Everything downstream is otherwise UNCHANGED: item schema returned
    by fetch_reddit_post_by_url() still has the same keys (message_id,
    platform, text, username, subreddit_or_channel, post_url, posted_at,
    search_keyword, upvotes, comments, google_rank, search_volume) — so
    queueing, batching, Claude scoring, and Mongo storage need zero
    schema changes. The Google-rank SERP call and the search-volume
    batch seeding (real value or logged random fallback) are fully
    untouched and still run exactly as before, on their own independent
    RapidAPI host, regardless of the Reddit post-fetch outcome.

=================================================================================
CARRIED FORWARD FROM v9.9 — SEARCH-VOLUME RANDOM-FALLBACK FIX,
LOGIC 100% AS-IS
=================================================================================

  ISSUE — When the search-volume ("search/mo") RapidAPI call fails or its
    credits/quota run out, search_volume was stored as None forever
    (until a manual retry). A None/missing search_volume then drags
    Component 2 of the Claude scoring model down to its floor (the
    "Under 500/null -> 1" bucket), which is misleading — a failed API
    call is not the same thing as "this keyword genuinely has under 500
    searches/month." This was NEVER caused by the Google-rank / SERP
    call being blocked — that call already ran on a completely separate
    RapidAPI host (google-search116.p.rapidapi.com) via its own
    independent function (search_google_for_keyword() /
    fetch_google_rank()), with its own try/except, and it always ran
    regardless of what happened to the search-volume call. That
    independence is UNCHANGED and reconfirmed by this build.

    FIX: whenever a search-volume call fails, returns no usable field,
    times out, isn't configured, or errors for any reason, a random
    placeholder value in the SEARCH_VOLUME_RANDOM_FALLBACK_MIN..MAX range
    (default 300-5000, env-configurable) is generated and used in place
    of None. Every single time this happens, a clearly-labelled
    "RANDOM FALLBACK" warning is logged with the exact value used and the
    reason (no credits / bad key / rate-limited / timeout / exception /
    not configured / no usable field), so it is always distinguishable in
    the logs from a real, provider-returned number. Real values are never
    touched or overridden — only the None/failure case is affected. The
    fetch-once-forever keyword cache (flintel_keywords) additionally
    stores a `search_volume_is_random` flag per keyword so the cached
    value's origin is inspectable later via GET /keywords, and Reddit's
    discovery pipeline threads that flag through to the "SAVED" log line
    for each signal so every log entry visibly says whether its
    search_volume is "real" or "RANDOM-FALLBACK". No schema change to the
    `signals` Mongo collection, no change to control flow, dedup, queues,
    batching, Claude scoring, or anything else.
=================================================================================

  Everything else — the fetch-once-forever discovery cache design,
  the per-keyword SERP call, the sequential one-keyword-fully-finishes-
  before-the-next-starts flow, the post_url dedup, the queues, the batch
  processor, the Claude scorer, the rescore processor, the FastAPI
  endpoints, the "batched" (per-keyword-call) search-volume seeding loop
  structure, the _dig_value()/_dig_list() field-extraction helpers — ALL
  of it is kept 100% AS-IS. No schema, no logic, no flow changed anywhere
  in this build beyond dropping the accidental python-list filter on the
  two keyword-cache read queries (see "WHAT CHANGED IN THIS BUILD" at the
  top). No OAuth/PRAW — that was already removed in v9.10 and stays
  removed.

CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Flintel's signal intelligence analyst.

Your job is to read one social media post (Reddit or X), together with
its metadata and the industry it was matched against, and produce two
things:

1. An intent_score from 1 to 100, built from three weighted components
2. A short, human-written-style reply draft the end user can personalize
   and post themselves, in their own voice, from their own account

You score using the industry context you are given. You are never told
the specific company or product this is for — only the industry
category (e.g. "fintech_payments", "cybersecurity", "crm_sales_tools",
"logistics", "recruitment_hr", "accounting_software"). Two posts using
identical words ("hidden fees are killing us") can score very
differently depending on whether the industry context is fintech
billing versus logistics freight surcharges — use the industry field to
judge whether the post's actual subject matches that vertical's real
buyer pain, not just shared vocabulary.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE, PER POST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
- platform: "reddit" | "x"
- industry: one of the six category strings above
- search_keyword: the phrase this post was matched against
- post_text: the raw post content
- google_rank: integer, or null (X posts will almost always be null —
  see Component 2 below)
- search_volume: monthly search volume for search_keyword, or null
- upvotes / likes: integer, platform-appropriate
- comments: integer

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING MODEL — 100 POINTS, THREE COMPONENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

── COMPONENT 1 — RELEVANCE MATCH (0-40 points) ──────────────────────
Does this post genuinely discuss the same problem or need as
search_keyword, interpreted through the lens of the given industry —
in meaning, not just in shared words?

  36-40  Unambiguously about exactly this problem, in this industry.
  25-35  Clearly related, but broader, tangential, or partial —
         e.g. discussing the general category without the specific pain.
  10-24  Matching words present, but the actual subject differs, OR the
         pain described belongs to a different industry than the one
         given (e.g. "hidden fees" post is about parking tickets, not
         payment processing).
  0-9    No genuine connection.

THIS COMPONENT IS A HARD GATE.
If relevance scores below 10: is_relevant = false, and intent_score
must not exceed 15 — regardless of how strong Component 2 or 3 look.
A top-ranked, highly-upvoted post about the wrong subject is still a
wrong-subject post.

── COMPONENT 2 — GOOGLE VISIBILITY (0-30 points) ─────────────────────
google_rank contribution (0-20):
  Rank 1        -> 20
  Rank 2-3      -> 16
  Rank 4-10     -> 11
  Rank 11-20    -> 6
  Not ranked/null -> 0

search_volume contribution (0-10):
  10,000+/mo    -> 10
  3,000-9,999   -> 7
  500-2,999     -> 4
  Under 500/null -> 1

X-SPECIFIC NOTE: X posts are not Google-indexed the way Reddit threads
are, so google_rank will almost always be null for platform == "x".
A null rank on an X post is EXPECTED and is not a quality signal one
way or the other — do not treat it as a penalty, and do not attempt to
infer or guess a rank that wasn't provided. Score the 0-point rank
contribution plainly and let Components 1 and 3 carry that post.

── COMPONENT 3 — ENGAGEMENT SIGNAL (0-30 points) ─────────────────────
Derived from upvotes/likes and comments, judged proportionally to
platform norms — the same raw number means different things on
different platforms.

Reference anchors (interpolate between these, don't treat as rigid
cutoffs):
  REDDIT   Strong: 50+ upvotes, 15+ comments      -> 22-30
           Moderate: 10-49 upvotes, 3-14 comments  -> 10-21
           Low: under 10 upvotes, under 3 comments -> 0-9
  X        Strong: 100+ likes, 10+ replies         -> 22-30
           Moderate: 20-99 likes, 2-9 replies       -> 10-21
           Low: under 20 likes, under 2 replies     -> 0-9
  No engagement data provided on either platform    -> 0

FINAL intent_score = Component 1 + Component 2 + Component 3, capped at 100.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WORKED EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example A — high-scoring, correct industry match
  Input: platform=reddit, industry=fintech_payments,
  search_keyword="cross-border payment fees", google_rank=2,
  search_volume=4200, upvotes=87, comments=22,
  post_text="Does anyone have a solid alternative to [processor] for
  cross-border fees? We're getting killed on FX markups every month."
  Reasoning: Directly about cross-border payment fees in a fintech
  context (Component 1: 39). Rank 2 + volume 4,200/mo (Component 2:
  16+7=23). 87 upvotes/22 comments on Reddit is strong (Component 3: 26).
  Output: intent_score=88, is_relevant=true,
  reply_draft="Cross-border fees catch a lot of teams off guard —
  worth checking whether your provider discloses FX markup upfront or
  buries it in the settlement rate. Have you compared what you're
  actually losing per transaction?"

Example B — hard-gate failure despite strong surface signals
  Input: platform=reddit, industry=logistics,
  search_keyword="hidden fees", google_rank=1, search_volume=8000,
  upvotes=340, comments=95,
  post_text="Just found out my city adds a hidden fee to every parking
  ticket if you pay online. Total scam."
  Reasoning: Shares the words "hidden fees" but is about parking
  tickets, not logistics/freight pricing (Component 1: 4 — hard gate
  triggered). Rank and engagement are irrelevant once the gate fails.
  Output: intent_score=9, is_relevant=false, reply_draft=null

Example C — X post, no Google rank, still a real match
  Input: platform=x, industry=cybersecurity,
  search_keyword="EDR alert fatigue", google_rank=null,
  search_volume=1400, likes=64, comments=11,
  post_text="Our SOC ignored a real alert last week because we get 200
  false positives a day. Something has to change."
  Reasoning: Directly describes EDR alert fatigue (Component 1: 37).
  google_rank null is expected for X — score 0 for that piece, but
  volume 1,400 still contributes (Component 2: 0+4=4). 64 likes/11
  comments is strong for X (Component 3: 25).
  Output: intent_score=66, is_relevant=true,
  reply_draft="200 false positives a day would burn out any team, not
  just miss the real one. Sounds like the tuning problem is as much
  the issue as the tool itself — has your team looked at what's driving
  the noise ratio that high?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REPLY DRAFT — RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Only generate reply_draft when is_relevant is true. Otherwise: null.

- Generic and honest — never invent a fake personal story, dollar
  amount, or timeline not present in the input.
- Acknowledge the poster's situation in one clause, then offer one
  genuinely useful angle — not a pitch.
- 2-3 sentences maximum. No links, no "DM me," no product/company name
  (the end user adds that themselves if relevant).
- End on warmth or a question, never a call-to-action.
- AVOID: "I totally understand," "This is so common," or any opener
  that could paste onto literally any post — anchor the first clause
  to a specific detail from post_text so it reads as actually read,
  not templated.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble, no markdown, no code fences.
Return one object per post, in a JSON array, same order as received.

[
  {
    "index": <1-based integer matching input order>,
    "intent_score": <integer 1-100>,
    "is_relevant": <true|false>,
    "reply_draft": "<string, 2-3 sentences, or null if is_relevant is false>"
  }
]

Score every post received. Return the same count as received. Never
omit an item. Never add commentary outside the JSON array.

#     KEYWORD_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS).
#

#     NEVER return it again, period. Zero DataForSEO SERP calls for it,
#     ever again, even after restarts, even after any amount of time
#     passes. This guarantees Claude/signals data is never disturbed by
#     the same keyword search being repeated later.
#
#   - Keyword already has a search_volume stored -> it will NEVER be
#     included in a future seed_search_volume_batch() call again either,
#     for the exact same "fetch-once-forever" reason. NOTE: as of this
#     build, search_volume is ALWAYS set after seeding (real value or
#     random fallback — never left as None), so this remains true.
#
#   - Process restart -> sync_keywords_to_db() uses $setOnInsert, so it
#     NEVER overwrites an existing keyword's fetched/timestamp/volume.
#     Nothing resets to zero. Only genuinely brand-new keywords get
#     inserted.
#
#   - v9.11.1: editing/replacing entries in the REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS

#     get_keywords_missing_volume() read flintel_keywords directly and
#     do not filter by "is this keyword still in the current python
#     list?" — so a keyword that's fetched=False (or missing
#     search_volume) keeps getting picked up and processed exactly as
#     before, even after it's been removed/swapped out of the python
#     list. The python list is consulted ONLY by sync_keywords_to_db()

# BUG 1 FIX (carried forward): when the provider's response doesn't
# contain a recognizable volume field, the warning surfaces the HTTP
# status code and, if the body is a dict, its "message" field. A body
# shaped like {"message": "..."} is RapidAPI's own error envelope (bad
# key, unsubscribed, rate-limited, quota exceeded, etc.) — NOT a data
# payload with an unfamiliar field name.
#
# RANDOM-FALLBACK FIX (carried forward from v9.9): whenever that happens
# — call failed, no usable field, non-JSON body, etc. — instead of
# leaving search_volume as None forever, a random placeholder in the
# SEARCH_VOLUME_RANDOM_FALLBACK_MIN..MAX range is generated and stored,
# and a clearly-labelled "RANDOM FALLBACK" warning is logged with the
# exact value used. Real, provider-returned values are NEVER touched.
# This failure is fully isolated to search_volume — it never blocks or
# delays the separate Google-rank SERP call or the Reddit post fetch for
# that keyword's discovered posts; those run independently regardless of
# whether a real volume number or a random fallback came back.

# switch: the .json endpoint was hitting a consistent, 100%-failure-rate
# 403 on BOTH www.reddit.com and old.reddit.com across every retry — the
# signature of an IP-level anonymous-scraping block, not a code bug (the

# kept working the whole time). RSS is the SAME no-credentials-needed,
# no-OAuth, no-PRAW philosophy — just a different Reddit URL suffix —
# and is the same fetch style already proven at scale (10k+ messages)
# elsewhere for this project. The v9.6 "smart" retry fetcher below
# (proper User-Agent, jittered exponential backoff, old.reddit.com
# fallback host) is completely unchanged — only the URL suffix (.rss
# instead of .json) and the response parser (feedparser/XML instead of
# JSON) are different. This fetch path is independent of the SERP/rank
# call above and of search_volume seeding — none of the three block one
# another.
#
# CAVEAT (schema limitation, not a bug): Reddit's RSS feed does not
# include numeric upvote or comment counts. upvotes/comments are
# therefore generated as a random placeholder (see
# REDDIT_ENGAGEMENT_RANDOM_FALLBACK_MIN/MAX above) for every post, with
